### Coordinator's message
Thank you very much for considering to contribute to this project. In previous years, I have tried some other interfaces like PyQt for interactive demonstrations. This academic year (2018-19), we are trying Jupyter notebooks for the first time. I hope that you find these notebooks instructive and playful. Please help up expand our collection. Yours truly! -Sanli

# About the Project

The **More Is Different** repository is a collaborative project for preparing interactive notebooks (in iPython) to demonstrate concepts in Condensed Matter Physics at the undergraduate and graduate level.

## Project Status

Just started! We have uploaded a couple of tested notebooks and will keep adding new notebooks during the course.

# Getting Started

If you are a student of Utrecht University NS-352B course and want to start a notebook as your project, discuss your ideas and plans first with the course coordinator.

If you have previous experience with using Python code for topics that fit the scope of this project, please share your code with us. Didactic Jupyter notebooks or the preferred format. 

If you have comments about the existing notebooks, please discuss them via issues.

# Best Practices

This is an education project. Most important principle is to keep its elements didactic and playful. Here are some recommendations based on the ["Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Research in Jupyter Notebook"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08055) paper.

### 1. Tell a Story for an Audience
Rather than only keep sporadic notes, use explanatory text to tell a compelling story that has a beginning that introduces the topic, a middle that describes your steps, and an end that interprets the results. Describe not just what you did, by why you did it, how the steps are connected, and what it all means.

### 2. Document the Process, Not Just the Results
If you do not have time to fully document what you are doing or thinking in the moment, leave short descriptive notes to remind yourself what to add when you get to a good stopping point.

### 3. Add Divisions to Make Steps Clear
Modularize your code by cells and label the cells with markdowns above the cell. Wrap code you are about to copy and reuse in a function

### 4. Share and Explain Your Data
Having access to a clearly-annotated notebook is of little use to reproducibility if the underlying
data is locked away. Strive to make your data, or a sample of your data, publicly available along with the notebook. Notebooks make it easy to provide a description of your input data and upstream processing steps, which are essential for interpreting results.

### 5. Enable Your Notebooks to Be Read, Run, and Explored
If you have followed the previous rules, your notebooks should capture your entire process and
be easy to read. But how will others access, run, and explore them? Ask classmates or colleagues to try to run one of your notebooks, and then listen when they explain what went wrong. 

# Code of Conduct
Please note we have a [code of conduct](./code_of_conduct.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.
