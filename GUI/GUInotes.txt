Here is a step-by-step starter guide for making a GUI with pyqtgraph.

Installation and warming up

* Make sure you have python 3+ or python 2.7 installed. 
* Install pyQt (both pyQt4 and pyQt5 are still maintained. Note that many pyqtgraph examples are for pyQt4)
* Install pyqtgraph from http://www.pyqtgraph.org/
* Check out the pyqtgraph examples (provided with the package)
	* In linux: python -m pyqtgraph.examples
	* in windows: through your python-IDE, for python 2.7 example are located in python2.7/dist-packages/pyqtgraph/examples/

* There are plenty of examples, good ones to start with are: Plotting.py, crosshair.py, imageAnalysis.py, scrollingPlots.py
* For more advanced multicore updating check RemoteSpeedTest.py


Building interactive GUIs

* For making a complex GUI with buttons and widgets, you can install QT creator package or only QT designer, check https://www.qt.io/
* Once you have exhausted your i-always-wanted-to-be-a-graphic-designer urge, you can look at the python code equivalent of the UI you have created by using pyuic4 (needs pyqt4-dev package)
	* example: pyuic4 simple.ui -o simpleGUI.py
