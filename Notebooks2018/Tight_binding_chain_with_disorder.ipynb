    "# Tight binding solution for a linear chain of atoms\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we numerically calculate the eigenstates of chain of atoms using the tight-binding method. We assume the single lowest orbital for each atom. The tight-binding Hamiltonian can be represented by a matrix with the diagonal elements $w$ and next-to-diagonal (hopping) terms $t$. The eigenvecters of this martix correspond to the on-site values of the eigenstates of the tight-binding Hamiltonian.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also add disorder to the diagonal terms to simulate the Anderson model, which results in exponentially localized states. Philip Anderson discovered this strong localization of states in his notable 1958 paper [\"Absence of Diffusion in Certain Random Lattices\"](https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.109.1492). This paper is one of the milestone papers in condensed matter physics, but only a few recognized its importance up to a decade after its publications. "
